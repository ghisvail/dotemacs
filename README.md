# My emacs settings

## Survival guide for the first week of emacs (copied from Magnars')

When you start using emacs for the first time, your habits fight you every inch
of the way. Your fingers long for the good old familiar keybindings. Here's an
overview of the most commonly used shortcuts to get you through this pain:

* `C      ` Shorthand for the ctrl-key
* `M      ` Shorthand for the meta-key (bound to cmd on my mac settings)
* `S      ` Shorthand for the shift-key

### Files

* `C-x C-f` Open a file. Starts in the current directory
* `C-x f  ` Open a recently visited file
* `C-x o  ` Open a file in the current project (based on .git ++)
* `C-x C-s` Save this file
* `C-x C-w` Save as ...
* `C-x C-j` Jump to this files' current directory
* `C-x b  ` Switch to another open file (buffer)
* `C-x C-b` List all open files (buffers)

### Cut copy and paste

* `C-space` Start marking stuff. C-g to cancel.
* `C-w    ` Cut (aka kill)
* `C-k    ` Cut till end of line

* `M-y    ` Cycle last paste through previous kills
* `C-x C-y` Choose what to paste from previous kills
